# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features (or variables) in a dataset while preserving the most important information. It accomplishes this by transforming the original features into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

### How PCA Works
##### Standardization:
Before applying PCA, it's essential to standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.

##### Covariance Matrix:
PCA computes the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between different features in the dataset.

##### Eigendecomposition:
PCA then performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, while eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.

##### Selecting Principal Components:
PCA selects the top k eigenvectors (principal components) based on the corresponding eigenvalues. These principal components capture the most significant variance in the data.

##### Projection:
Finally, PCA projects the original data onto the subspace spanned by the selected principal components. This results in a lower-dimensional representation of the data while retaining as much variance as possible.

## Usage
PCA is widely used in various fields, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data visualization. It's particularly useful for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets, improving computational efficiency, and removing noise or redundant information.
